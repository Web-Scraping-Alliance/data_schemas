Web Scraping Alliance
=====================

The objective of the web scraping alliance is to offer an industry wide standard definition of scraped items,
this will allow easy usage between companies and better integration on automated systems

This repository contains the structures of data schemas we are the result of the web scraping alliance,
and are free to use.

How the schemas are defined
---------------------------
The main purpose of defining a schema is to have an json object that can be used in many case as possible,
for example the `product` schema should be in any e-commerce website instead of having an schema per website.

To propose a new schema, it should be for information tha any of the existing schemas cannot be applied to.

How to collaborate
------------------
This is an open repository, anyone can make a pull request but the acceptance is determined by a majority/consensus of all members.
