Web Scraping Alliance
=====================

The objective of the Web Scraping Alliance is to establish an industry-wide standard definition for web extracted data,
facilitating seamless data exchange between companies and enhancing integration into automated systems.

Within this repository, you'll find data schema structures that result from the collaboration of the Web Scraping Alliance.
These schemas are freely available for use.


How the schemas are defined
---------------------------
The primary purpose of defining a schema is to create a JSON object that can be applied across various use cases.
For instance, the `product` schema should be universally applicable to any e-commerce website, eliminating the need for a specific schema per site.

To propose a new schema, it should be for data that cannot be accommodated by any of the existing schemas.
